# quick-network-scan
This repository can be used for doing a brief scan on a network and enumerating a very basic level of http, smtp, snmp and samba information. It is an attempt to put together whatever I have learnt for the initial enumeration of a box using the different tools available. I would be updating the script as I learn more about the penetration testing.
